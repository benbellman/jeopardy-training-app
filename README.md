# Web application for studying old Jeopardy! questions

This is a quick application I've put together for my mom, who will be appearing on Jeopardy! in the near future. Happy birthday, Mom!!!

The app is currently live at: https://ben-bellman.shinyapps.io/jeopardy-training-app/.

Questions come from j-archive.com.
